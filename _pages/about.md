I am currently a senior at Michigan State University, double majoring in Computer Science and Advanced Mathematics. Throughout my 4-year undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to be mentored by Professor [Jiayu Zhou](https://jiayuzhou.github.io/) and worked within the [Intelligent Data Analytics (ILLIDAN) Lab](https://illidanlab.github.io/#about).

My research interests center on trustworthy machine learning, particularly focusing on robustness, privacy, and explainability, with practical applications in healthcare settings. My goal is to develop machine learning systems for healthcare diagnostics that are robust and reliable enough for real-world implementation, ensuring that predictions are interpretable to bring valuable insights instead of just serving as a black box model with yes/no output.

Outside of my research, I have a strong passion for algorithms and data structures. I am among the top 0.3% of algorithm contestants on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/caobaohoang03/) and have represented Michigan State University in [International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest) three times ([ranking](https://icpc.global/ICPCID/0UGBYW44O1V1)).
